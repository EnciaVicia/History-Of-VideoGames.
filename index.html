                    called OXO, developed by Alexander S. Douglas in 1952. The game was
                    a computerized version of tic tac toe that ran on the
                    EDSAC (computer of the time) and allowed to face a human player

                colors, sound and gameplay over previous consoles.</p>
            <p class="card__p2">Nintendo, a Japanese company that began as a playing card manufacturer in 1889, released

                    other long-lasting franchises, such as Capcom’s Mega Man, Konami’s Castlevania, Square’s Final
                    Fantasy, and Enix’s Dragon Quest (Square and Enix would later merge to form Square Enix in 2003).

                        25 years, Nintendo would release a number of successful successors to the Game Boy, including
